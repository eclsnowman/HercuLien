These belt tensioners were designed with the following goals in mind:

1) Simplify the belt-tensioning procedure
	Belt tension can now be adjusted by turning a single screw with a hex key.

2) Allow for carriage changes without gantry disassembly
	The original belt tensioners did not provide enough clearance with the 20x80mm
	side extrusions to remove the gantry cross-rods without removing side rods.
	These carriages easily rotate without the need to remove belts or additional rods
	thus providing ease in changing/modifying the hotend carriage. 

3) Provide a longer axis for bushing alignment while maintaining build area
	The EZ carriages provide an additional 1cm spacing between self-aligning bushings
	(should theoretically allow for less bushing deviation) while maintaining the same
	build area. In order to accomplish this a different endstop mount was implemented

4) Reduce hardware part count
	(1) M3x20 button head or socket head cap screw
	(1) M3x35 socket head cap screw
	(2) M3 hex nuts

Note on endstop and belt-tensioner .stl file generation:
Both the endstop mounts and belt tensioners (as well as belt-tensioner blocks) are generated
from single .sldprt files. The .stl files for the opposing pieces are generated by mirroring the 
.stl files (across X or Y for belt tensioners and across Z for endstop mounts).


Additionally, this folder contains a tool that may be printed to aid in bushing installation. 
Use of the tool allows for bushings to be inserted without damaging the sintered brass portion
of the bushing. Simply lay the tool on the table and plase a bushing onto the tool (flared side
down) and push the bushing into the hole of the belt-tensioner block.
