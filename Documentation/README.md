Herculien Build Guide
=====================

This guide is intended to get you through the basics of assembling the Herculien
3D Printer.  It is a living document so be aware that the procedure is subject to change.

Pictures are included for clarity and where necessary YouTube videos will be embedded.

The guide will be structured around the subassemblies that are listed in the BOM however
to save time later we will include parts/fasteners from other subassemblies where
needed.

Tools Required
==============

 * 2.5mm Hex Wrench
 * 3mm Hex Wrench
 * Bubble Level (for leveling the Z Gantry)
 * Multimeter
 * Saw for cutting aluminum
 * Marker
 * Masking tape
 * Metric tap set (only a 5mm tap is required)
 * Drill
 * 2mm drill bit
 * 5mm drill bit
 * 8mm drill bit
 * 7/8" drill bit
 * 1/2" End mill
 
Metal Preparation
=================

 1. Using the 5mm x .8 thread tap, tap all of the regular 20x80 extrusion end holes
    * Use cutting oil
    * Go Slow
    * You can either do by hand or using a drill.  If you use a drill you must take it VERY slow as you can easily break the tap bit.

Main Frame
==========

## Parts required:

 * 9x 20x80 Aluminum Extrusions cut to 569.5mm
 * 4x 20x20 Aluminum Extrusions cut to 609.5mm
 * 2x 20x80 V-Slot Aluminum Extrusions
 * 102x T-Slot Nuts
 * 160x M5 x 10mm Button Head Screws
 * 6x M5 x 8mm Flat Head Socket Cap Screws
 * 16x M5 x 8mm Button Head Screws

## Steps

 1. The BOM lists a 1 meter section of V-Slot, if you haven't cut the V-Slot you should do that now.
    * To cut the V-Slot you can use any saw or cutting wheel capable of cutting through a 20x80 extrusion.
    * I was successful doing this with an angle grinder and metal cutoff blade.
    * While you should be careful to cut this as straight as possible it isn't necessary to
      cut this exactly straight.  The factory cut ends are straight and those will be what is used
      to square the verticals for the Z Gantry rails to be perpendicular to the center rail.
    
 2. Using your marker and masking tape, label each of the 9 20x80 extrusions using the following labels.  These labels aren't necessary
    but will make things easier in the following steps to keep things in order.  It also helps to indicate which end it up, I use arrows
    on the masking labels.
    
    * Top Front
    * Top Rear
    * Top Right
    * Top Left
    * Bottom Front
    * Bottom Rear
    * Bottom Right
    * Bottom Left

 3. Using your marker and masking tape, label each of the 4 20x20 extrusions with the following labels.
    * Front Right
    * Rear Right
    * Front Left
    * Rear Left
